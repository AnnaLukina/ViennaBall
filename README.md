Projection mapping for Vienna Ball of Sciences 2019 (https://www.wissenschaftsball.at/das-ballmagazin-2019/)

Processing.py (https://py.processing.org/)

Science is similar to the natural phenomenon of emergent collective behavior such as flocking. Swarms of facts gradually build on the foundations of various scientific disciplines shaping their state-of-the-art. Ideas are all around us, constantly evolving, communicating, and charging us with their energy like electrons. Catching them and following logical steps to generate the waves of knowledge is Art. Giving each fact we learn a home, a structure, that can be easily accessed by its flockmates is Logic.

The animation consists of three parts: flocking forming the word "SCIENCE" on the steps; steps starting to wave and nucleii flying around them; logical cubes rolling down the steps and releasing the flocks.

DISCLAIMER: the work was done without prior knowledge or experience in 3D projection mapping. Great thanks to processing.org and Daniel Shiffman's tutorials.
